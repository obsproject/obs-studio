Version 2.9
===========

Released 2016-09-18

===========

Released 2016-08-30

* New features:

  - Always preserve insertion order of object items.
    `json_object_iter()` and friends, `json_object_foreach()` and
    `json_dumps()` and friends now always work in the insertion order of
    object items (#293).

  - Add `json_object_foreach_safe()` macro that allows
    `json_object_del()` calls during iteration (#230).

  - Add `json_get_alloc_funcs()` to allow reading the allocation
    functions set by `json_set_alloc_funcs()` (#262, #264).

  - Fix a crash when parsing inputs consisting of very deeply nested
    arrays or objects (#282, #284).

    JSON_DECODE_INT_AS_REAL is set. This fixes error messages for
    overflowing numbers when JSON_DECODE_INT_AS_REAL is set (#212).

  - Fix a use-after-free in `json_pack()` error handling.

  - Fix subnormal number parsing on mingw32.

    path (#209).

  - Add a build-time option to set initial hashtable size (#213).

  - Use snprintf and strncpy in place of sprintf and strcpy to silence
    linker warnings on OpenBSD (#233).

* Documentation:

  - Fix various typos in documentation, and a broken link (#258).

  - Add an example program in ``examples/`` (#214, #217).

  - Fix building of documentation man pages (#207).

  - Document the fact that copying objects doesn't preserve the
    insertion order of keys (#237).

  - Don't use the nonstandard __FUNCTION__ macro in tests.

  - Use expr instead of $((...)) in shell scripts for Solaris 10
    compatibility.

===========

Released 2014-10-02

* New features:

  - `json_pack()` and friends: Add format specifiers ``s%`` and ``+%``
    for a size_t string length (#141).

    unpacking the string length along with the string itself (#141).

  - Add length-aware string constructors `json_stringn()` and
    `json_stringn_nocheck()`, length-aware string mutators
    `json_string_setn()` and `json_string_setn_nocheck()`, and a
    function for getting string's length `json_string_length()` (#141,
    #143).

    enabled by using the ``JSON_ALLOW_NUL`` decoding flag (#141).

  - Add `json_boolean_value()` as an alias for `json_is_true()`
    (#146).

  - Add JSON_REAL_PRECISION encoding flag/macro for controlling real
    number precision (#178).

  - Define the maximum indentation as JSON_MAX_INDENT (#191).

Version 2.6
===========

Released 2014-02-11

* Security:

  - CVE-2013-6401: The hash function used by the hashtable
    implementation has been changed, and is automatically seeded with
    random data when the first JSON object is created. This prevents

    ``JSON_ENCODE_ANY`` is set.

  - Fix a theoretical integer overflow in `jsonp_strdup()`.

  - Fix `l_isxdigit()` macro (#97).

  - Fix an off-by-one error in `json_array_remove()`.

* Build:

  - Support CMake in addition to GNU Autotools (#106, #107, #112,
    #115, #120, #127).

Version 2.4
===========

Released 2012-09-23

* New features:

  - Add `json_boolean()` macro that returns the JSON true or false
    value based on its argument (#86).

    repeatedly to read the JSON input (#57).

  - Add JSON_ESCAPE_SLASH encoding flag to escape all occurences of
    ``/`` with ``\/``.

    values resulted in invalid JSON.

    includes solution and project files in ``win32/vs2010/``
    directory.

Version 2.3.1
=============

Released 2012-04-20

  - `json_unpack()` and friends: Add support for optional object keys
    with the ``{s?o}`` syntax.

    `json_object_update_missing()`, for updating only existing keys or
    only adding missing keys to an object. (#37)

  - Add `json_object_foreach()` for more convenient iteration over
    objects. (#45, #46)

  - When decoding JSON, write the number of bytes that were read from
    input to ``error.position`` also on success. This is handy with
    ``JSON_DISABLE_EOF_CHECK``.

  - Add support for decoding any JSON value, not just arrays or
    objects. The support is enabled with the new ``JSON_DECODE_ANY``
    flag. Patch by Andrea Marchesini. (#4)

* Bug fixes:

  - Fix an additional memory leak when memory allocation fails in
    `json_object_set()` and friends.

  - Clear errno before calling `strtod()` for better portability. (#27)

Version 2.0
===========

Released 2011-02-28

This release is backwards incompatible with the 1.x release series.
See the chapter "Upgrading from older versions" in documentation for
details.

* Backwards incompatible changes:

  - Unify unsigned integer usage in the API: All occurences of
    unsigned int and unsigned long have been replaced with size_t.

  - Change JSON integer's underlying type to the widest signed integer
    type available, i.e. long long if it's supported, otherwise long.
    Add a typedef json_int_t that defines the type.

  - Change the maximum indentation depth to 31 spaces in encoder. This
    frees up bits from the flags parameter of encoding functions
    `json_dumpf()`, `json_dumps()` and `json_dump_file()`.

  - For future needs, add a flags parameter to all decoding functions
    `json_loadf()`, `json_loads()` and `json_load_file()`.

* New features

  - `json_pack()`, `json_pack_ex()`, `json_vpack_ex()`: Create JSON
    values based on a format string.

  - `json_unpack()`, `json_unpack_ex()`, `json_vunpack_ex()`: Simple
    value extraction and validation functionality based on a format
    string.

  - Add column, position and source fields to the ``json_error_t``
    struct.

  - Enhance error reporting in the decoder.

  - ``JANSSON_VERSION`` et al.: Preprocessor constants that define the
    library version.

  - `json_set_alloc_funcs()`: Set custom memory allocation functions.

* Fix many portability issues, especially on Windows.

* Configuration

  - Add file ``jansson_config.h`` that contains site specific
    configuration. It's created automatically by the configure script,
    or can be created by hand if the configure script cannot be used.
    The file ``jansson_config.h.win32`` can be used without
    modifications on Windows systems.

  - Add a section to documentation describing how to build Jansson on
    Windows.

  - Documentation now requires Sphinx 1.0 or newer.


Version 1.3
===========

Released 2010-06-13

* New functions:

  - `json_object_iter_set()`, `json_object_iter_set_new()`: Change
    object contents while iterating over it.

  - `json_object_iter_at()`: Return an iterator that points to a
    specific object item.

* New encoding flags:

  - ``JSON_PRESERVE_ORDER``: Preserve the insertion order of object
    keys.

* Bug fixes:

  - Fix an error that occured when an array or object was first
    encoded as empty, then populated with some data, and then
    re-encoded

  - Fix the situation like above, but when the first encoding resulted
    in an error

* Documentation:

  - Clarify the documentation on reference stealing, providing an
    example usage pattern


Version 1.2.1
=============

    issuing an error

* Portability:

  - Make ``int32_t`` available on all systems
  - Support compilers that don't have the ``inline`` keyword
  - Require Autoconf 2.60 (for ``int32_t``)

* Tests:

  - Print test names correctly when ``VERBOSE=1``
  - ``test/suites/api``: Fail when a test fails
  - Enhance tests for iterators
  - Enhance tests for decoding texts that contain null bytes

* Documentation:

  - Don't remove ``changes.rst`` in ``make clean``
  - Add a chapter on RFC conformance


Version 1.2
===========

Released 2010-01-21

* New functions:

  - `json_equal()`: Test whether two JSON values are equal
  - `json_copy()` and `json_deep_copy()`: Make shallow and deep copies
    of JSON values
  - Add a version of all functions taking a string argument that
    doesn't check for valid UTF-8: `json_string_nocheck()`,
    `json_string_set_nocheck()`, `json_object_set_nocheck()`,
    `json_object_set_new_nocheck()`

* New encoding flags:

  - ``JSON_SORT_KEYS``: Sort objects by key
  - ``JSON_ENSURE_ASCII``: Escape all non-ASCII Unicode characters
  - ``JSON_COMPACT``: Use a compact representation with all unneeded
    whitespace stripped

* Bug fixes:

  - Revise and unify whitespace usage in encoder: Add spaces between
    array and object items, never append newline to output.
  - Remove const qualifier from the ``json_t`` parameter in
    `json_string_set()`, `json_integer_set()` and `json_real_set`.
  - Use ``int32_t`` internally for representing Unicode code points
    (int is not enough on all platforms)

* Other changes:

  - Convert ``CHANGES`` (this file) to reStructured text and add it to
    HTML documentation
  - The test system has been refactored. Python is no longer required
    to run the tests.
  - Documentation can now be built by invoking ``make html``
  - Support for pkg-config
