 * Test the default (type not set) mutex type.
 * Should be the same as PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL.
 * Thread locks then trylocks mutex (attempted recursive lock).
 * The thread should lock first time and EBUSY second time.
 *
 * Depends on API functions: 
 *	pthread_mutex_lock()
 *	pthread_mutex_trylock()
 *	pthread_mutex_unlock()
