SuperResolution.Filter.Desc="The Super Resolution filter, while preserving the content, improves the resolution of low-resolution videos, enhances the details, and sharpens the output.\nThis filter enhances the resolution of low-resolution videos and enhances the details and sharpens the output while preserving the content.\n\nThe Upscaling filter is a very fast and light-weight method for upscaling an input video.\n\nHere are some general recommendations:\nIf a video without encoding artifacts needs a fast resolution increase, use Upscaling.\nIf a video has no encoding artifacts, to increase the resolution, use SuperRes with mode 1 for greater enhancement.\nIf a video has fewer encoding artifacts, to remove artifacts, use Artifact Reduction only mode 0.\nIf a video has more encoding artifacts, use Artifact Reduction only with mode 1.\nFor light artifacts, use SuperRes with mode 0.\nOtherwise, use Artifact Reduction and SuperRes with mode 1."

SuperResolution.SRMode.Strong="Mode 1"
SuperResoltuion.SRMode.Desc="Mode 0 will apply a harder blending effect, which can remove very fine subtle details but can also keep lines thicker. Can also be used to blend subtle dithering into a smooth gradient.\nMode 1 attempts to preserve the original image as closely as possible, imperfections and all. Will have a sharpening halo effect on lower resolution source material using large upscale multipliers"
SuperResolution.AR="AI Artifact Reduction Pre-Pass"
SuperResolution.ARDesc="Supports a maximum of 1080p source resolution.\nThis WILL alter the color of your image.\nThis has a non-zero GPU impact in both utilization and VRAM use.\nAttempts to remove minor compression artifacts from the image.\nThis will not remove extreme compression artifacting, but may smooth it out better than nothing."

SuperResolution.ARMode.Strong="Mode 1"
SuperResolution.ARMode.Desc="This filter reduces encoder artifacts, such as blocking artifacts, ringing, mosquito noise from a low-bitrate video while preserving the details of the original video.\nMode 0 Removes lesser artifacts, preserves low gradient information better, and is suited for higher bitrate videos.\nMode 1 is better suited for lower bitrate videos."

SuperResolution.Scale.Desc="Scaling Multipliers.\nThe nVidia VFX SDK powering this plugin does not allow for arbitrary scaling, only these specific multipliers.\nSuper Resolution is restricted in the resolutions it supports. This is a limitation of the nVidia VFX SDK powering this plugin.\n\nUpscaling does not have resolution restrictions and can be used with any arbitrary source size that your hardware can support."
