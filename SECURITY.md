## Introduction
The OBS Project is an open source project, which develops and distributes the open source application OBS Studio

Official Channels are our [Discord Server](https://obsproject.com/discord) or security@obsproject.com email address.

## Guidelines
We require all security researchers to:

- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations;
- Perform research only within the scope set out below;
- Be clear and succinct, a short proof-of-concept link is invaluable; and
- Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between us until we’ve had 120 days to resolve the issue.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:

- Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission);

## Expectations
When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

- Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely initial response to the submission;
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner; and
- Recognize your contribution to improving our security if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or configuration change.

## In-Scope Vulnerabilities
The vulnerabilities listed here are explicitly eligible for our security program. Any design or implementation issue that substantially affects the confidentiality or integrity of user data is likely to be in scope for the program. Common examples include:

- Remote Code Execution (RCE)

While this list represents areas we focus on, we are interested in reports for all of our software and dependencies especially if it impacts reasonably sensitive user data. 

This can include any open source libraries, software, or third-party components. We do, however, recommend reporting dependency vulnerabilities to the dependency vendor.

## Out-of-Scope Vulnerabilities
The following are considered out of scope for our security program and should not be submitted:

- Password, email and account policies, such as email id verification, reset link expiration, and password complexity.
- Attacks requiring physical access to a user's device.
- Vulnerabilities that require a potential victim to install non-standard software or otherwise take active steps to make themselves susceptible (this includes “DLL planting”).
- Reports from automated tools or scans that haven't been manually verified.
- UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes.
- Web server “security headers”, TLS cipher choices, email SPF / DKIM / DMARC or similar (lack of) best practices that do not actively lead to a vulnerability.

## Ground Rules
To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between legitimate research and malicious attack, we ask that you attempt, in good faith, to:

- Play by the rules. This includes following this policy and any other relevant agreements;
- Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly;
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience;
- Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us;
- Handle the confidentiality of details of any discovered vulnerabilities according to our Disclosure Policy;
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope;
- Do not run crawlers or other automated tools against our infrastructure; and
- Do not engage in extortion.

## Safe Harbor
When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider this research conducted under this policy to be:

- Authorized in view of any applicable anti-hacking laws, and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
- Authorized in view of relevant anti-circumvention laws, and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
- Exempt from restrictions in our Acceptable Usage Policy that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis; and
- Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our Official Channels before going any further.

## Bug Bounty
The OBS Project does not have the resources to maintain an active bug bounty program, and all reports are made in good faith, for responsible disclosure and the overall safety of the application and our community. Requests for payment or refusal to provide details until a payment is provided are unwelcome.
