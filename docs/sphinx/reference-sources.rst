Source API Reference (obs_source_t)
===================================

Sources are used to render video and/or audio on stream.  Things such as
capturing displays/games/audio, playing a video, showing an image, or
playing audio.  Sources can also be used to implement audio and video
filters as well as transitions.  The `libobs/obs-source.h`_ file is the
dedicated header for implementing sources.

.. type:: obs_source_t

   A reference-counted video/audio input source.

.. type:: obs_weak_source_t

   A weak reference to an video/audio input source.

.. code:: cpp

   #include <obs.h>


Source Definition Structure (obs_source_info)
---------------------------------------------

.. struct:: obs_source_info

   Source definition structure.

.. member:: const char *obs_source_info.id

   Unique string identifier for the source (required).

.. member:: uint32_t version

   Source version (optional).

   This is used when a source's implementation is significantly
   modified and the previous version is deprecated, but is kept to
   prevent old sources from breaking.

.. member:: enum obs_source_type obs_source_info.type

   Type of source.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_TYPE_INPUT**      - Video/Audio Input
   - **OBS_SOURCE_TYPE_FILTER**     - Filter
   - **OBS_SOURCE_TYPE_TRANSITION** - Transition

.. member:: uint32_t obs_source_info.output_flags

   Source output capability flags (required).

   (Author's note: This should be renamed to "capability_flags")

   A bitwise OR combination of one or more of the following values:

   - **OBS_SOURCE_VIDEO** - Source has video

     Unless SOURCE_ASYNC_VIDEO is specified, the source must include the
     :c:member:`obs_source_info.video_render` callback in the source
     definition structure.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_AUDIO** - Source has audio

     Use the :c:func:`obs_source_output_audio()` function to pass raw
     audio data, which will be automatically converted and uploaded.  If
     used with OBS_SOURCE_ASYNC_VIDEO, audio will automatically be
     synced up to the video output based upon their mutual timestamps.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_ASYNC** - Video is asynchronous (use
     OBS_SOURCE_ASYNC_VIDEO instead to automatically combine this flag
     with the OBS_SOURCE_VIDEO flag).

   - **OBS_SOURCE_ASYNC_VIDEO** - Source passes raw video data via RAM

     Use the :c:func:`obs_source_output_video()` function to pass raw
     video data, which will be automatically drawn at a timing relative
     to the provided timestamp.

     If audio is also present on the source, the audio will
     automatically be synced to the video based upon their mutual
     timestamps.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_CUSTOM_DRAW** - Source uses custom graphics calls,
     rather than just rendering a single texture.

     This capability flag must be used if the source does not use
     :c:func:`obs_source_draw()` to render a single texture.

     This capability flag is an important hint to turn off a specific
     optimization that allows the first effect filter in the filter
     chain to render the source directly with that effect filter.  The
     optimization does not work if there are custom graphics calls, and
     the source must be rendered to a texture first before being sent to
     the first filter in the filter chain.

     (Author's note: Ironically, not many sources render with that
     optimization.  I should have made it so that the optimization isn't
     used by default, and a flag should have been used to turn on the
     optimization -- not turn it off).

   - **OBS_SOURCE_INTERACTION** - Source can be interacted with by the
     user.

     When this is used, the source will receive interaction events if
     these callbacks are provided:
     :c:member:`obs_source_info.mouse_click`,
     :c:member:`obs_source_info.mouse_move`,
     :c:member:`obs_source_info.mouse_wheel`,
     :c:member:`obs_source_info.focus`, and
     :c:member:`obs_source_info.key_click`.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_COMPOSITE** - Source composites child sources

     When used, specifies that the source composites one or more child
     sources.  Scenes and transitions are examples of sources that
     contain and render child sources.

     Sources that render sub-sources must implement the audio_render
     callback in order to perform custom audio mixing of child sources.

     This capability flag is always set for transitions.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_DO_NOT_DUPLICATE** - Source should not be fully
     duplicated.

     When this is used, specifies that the source should not be fully
     duplicated, and should prefer to duplicate via holding references
     rather than full duplication.

     When functions such as :c:func:`obs_source_duplicate()` or
     :c:func:`obs_scene_duplicate()` are called, sources or child
     sources with this flag will never be fully duplicated, and will
     instead only be referenced.

     An example of the type of sources that should not be fully
     duplicated are video devices, browsers, and video/audio captures,
     as they will either not function correctly or will cause
     performance or resource issues when duplicated.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_DEPRECATED** - Source is deprecated and should not be
     used.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_DO_NOT_SELF_MONITOR** - Audio of this source should
     not allow monitoring if the current monitoring device is the same
     device being captured by the source.

     This flag is used as a hint to the back-end to prevent the source
     from creating an audio feedback loop.  This is primarily only used
     with desktop audio capture sources.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_CAP_DISABLED** - This source type has been disabled
     and should not be shown as a type of source the user can add.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_CAP_OBSOLETE** - This source type is obsolete and
     should not be shown as a type of source the user can add.
     Identical to *OBS_SOURCE_CAP_DISABLED*.  Meant to be used when a
     source has changed in some way (mostly defaults/properties), but
     you want to avoid breaking older configurations.  Basically solves
     the problem of "I want to change the defaults of a source but I
     don't want to break people's configurations"

   - **OBS_SOURCE_CONTROLLABLE_MEDIA** - This source has media that can
     be controlled

   - **OBS_SOURCE_MONITOR_BY_DEFAULT** - Source should enable
     monitoring by default.  Monitoring should be set by the
     frontend if this flag is set.

   - **OBS_SOURCE_CEA_708** - Source type provides cea708 data

   - **OBS_SOURCE_SRGB** - Source understands SRGB rendering

   - **OBS_SOURCE_CAP_DONT_SHOW_PROPERTIES** - Source type prefers not
     to have its properties shown on creation (prefers to rely on
     defaults first)

   - **OBS_TRANSITION_HAS_AUDIO** - Transition has child sources with
     audio. Hint for the UI to enable advanced audio controls.
     Transitions using this can implement a `transition_audio_update`
     procedure to apply the audio properties from the transition's
     settings to the child sources, or rely on `source_update`.

     .. versionadded:: next

.. member:: const char *(*obs_source_info.get_name)(void *type_data)

   Get the translated name of the source type.

   :param  type_data:  The type_data variable of this structure
   :return:            The translated name of the source type

.. member:: void *(*obs_source_info.create)(obs_data_t *settings, obs_source_t *source)

   Creates the implementation data for the source.

   :param  settings: Settings to initialize the source with
   :param  source:   Source that this data is associated with
   :return:          The implementation data associated with this source

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.destroy)(void *data)

   Destroys the implementation data for the source.

   Async sources must not call obs_source_output_video after returning
   from destroy.

.. member:: uint32_t (*obs_source_info.get_width)(void *data)
            uint32_t (*obs_source_info.get_height)(void *data)

   Returns the width/height of the source.  These callbacks are required
   if this is a video source and is synchronous.

   (Author's note: These should really be consolidated in to one
   function, not two)

   :return: The width/height of the video

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.get_defaults)(obs_data_t *settings)
            void (*obs_source_info.get_defaults2)(void *type_data, obs_data_t *settings)

   Sets the default settings for this source.

   :param  settings:  Default settings.  Call obs_data_set_default*
                      functions on this object to set default setting
                      values

.. member:: obs_properties_t *(*obs_source_info.get_properties)(void *data)
            obs_properties_t *(*obs_source_info.get_properties2)(void *data, void *type_data)

   Gets the property information of this source.
   
   :param  data:  The implementation data associated with this source.
                  This value can be null (e.g., when
                  :c:func:`obs_get_source_properties()` is called on the
                  source type), make sure to handle this gracefully.

   (Optional)

   :return: The properties of the source

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.update)(void *data, obs_data_t *settings)

   Updates the settings for this source.

   (Optional)

   :param settings: New settings for this source

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.activate)(void *data)

   Called when the source has been activated in the main view (visible
   on stream/recording).

   (Optional)

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.deactivate)(void *data)

   Called when the source has been deactivated from the main view (no
   longer visible on stream/recording).

   (Optional)

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.show)(void *data)

   Called when the source is visible on any display and/or on the main
   view.

   (Optional)

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.hide)(void *data)

   Called when the source is no longer visible on any display and/or on
   the main view.

   (Optional)

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.video_tick)(void *data, float seconds)

   Called each video frame with the time elapsed.

   (Optional)

   :param  seconds: Seconds elapsed since the last frame

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.video_render)(void *data, gs_effect_t *effect)

   Called when rendering the source with the graphics subsystem.

   If this is an input/transition source, this is called to draw the
   source texture with the graphics subsystem.

   If this is a filter source, it wraps source draw calls (for example
   applying a custom effect with custom parameters to a source).  In
   this case, it's highly recommended to use the
   :c:func:`obs_source_process_filter_begin()` and
   :c:func:`obs_source_process_filter_end()` functions to automatically
   handle effect-based filter processing.  However, you can implement
   custom draw handling as desired as well.

   If the source output capability flags do not include
   OBS_SOURCE_CUSTOM_DRAW, the source must use
   :c:func:`obs_source_draw()` to render the source's texture.

   :param effect: This parameter is no longer used.  Instead, call
                  :c:func:`obs_source_draw()`

.. member:: struct obs_source_frame *(*obs_source_info.filter_video)(void *data, struct obs_source_frame *frame)

   Called to filter raw async video data.  This function is only used
   with asynchronous video filters.

   :param  frame: Video frame to filter
   :return:       New video frame data.  This can defer video data to
                  be drawn later if time is needed for processing

.. member:: struct obs_audio_data *(*obs_source_info.filter_audio)(void *data, struct obs_audio_data *audio)

   Called to filter raw audio data.  This function is only used with
   audio filters.

   :param  audio: Audio data to filter
   :return:       Modified or new audio data.  You can directly modify
                  the data passed and return it, or you can defer audio
                  data for later if time is needed for processing.  If
                  you are returning new data, that data must exist until
                  the next call to the
                  :c:member:`obs_source_info.filter_audio` callback or
                  until the filter is removed/destroyed

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.enum_active_sources)(void *data, obs_source_enum_proc_t enum_callback, void *param)

   Called to enumerate all active sources being used within this
   source.  If the source has children that render audio/video it must
   implement this callback.  Only used with sources that have the
   OBS_SOURCE_COMPOSITE output capability flag.

   :param  enum_callback: Enumeration callback
   :param  param:         User data to pass to callback

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.save)(void *data, obs_data_t *settings)

   Called when saving custom data for a source.  This is a separate
   function because sometimes a source needs to know when it is being
   saved so it doesn't always have to update the current settings until
   a certain point.

   (Optional)

   :param  settings: Settings object to save data to

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.load)(void *data, obs_data_t *settings)

   Called when loading custom data from saved source data.  This is
   called after all the loading sources have actually been created,
   allowing the ability to reference other sources if desired.

   (Optional)

   :param  settings: Settings object to load data from

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.mouse_click)(void *data, const struct obs_mouse_event *event, int32_t type, bool mouse_up, uint32_t click_count)

   Called when interacting with a source and a mouse-down or mouse-up
   occurs.  Only used with sources that have the OBS_SOURCE_INTERACTION
   output capability flag.

   (Optional)

   :param event:       Mouse event properties
   :param type:        Mouse button pushed
   :param mouse_up:    Mouse event type (true if mouse-up)
   :param click_count: Mouse click count (1 for single click, etc.)

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.mouse_move)(void *data, const struct obs_mouse_event *event, bool mouse_leave)

   Called when interacting with a source and a mouse-move occurs.  Only
   used with sources that have the OBS_SOURCE_INTERACTION output
   capability flag.

   (Optional)

   :param event:       Mouse event properties

   Called when interacting with a source and a mouse-wheel occurs.  Only
   used with sources that have the OBS_SOURCE_INTERACTION output
   capability flag.

   Called when interacting with a source and gain focus/lost focus event
   occurs.  Only used with sources that have the OBS_SOURCE_INTERACTION
   output capability flag.

   occurs.  Only used with sources that have the OBS_SOURCE_INTERACTION
   output capability flag.

   :param  source: Source that the filter being removed from

.. member:: void *obs_source_info.type_data
            void (*obs_source_info.free_type_data)(void *type_data)

   Private data associated with this entry.  Note that this is not the
   same as the implementation data; this is used to differentiate
   between two different types if the same callbacks are used for more
   than one different type.

.. member:: bool (*obs_source_info.audio_render)(void *data, uint64_t *ts_out, struct obs_source_audio_mix *audio_output, uint32_t mixers, size_t channels, size_t sample_rate)

   that have the OBS_SOURCE_COMPOSITE output capability flag.

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.enum_all_sources)(void *data, obs_source_enum_proc_t enum_callback, void *param)

   Called to enumerate all active and inactive sources being used
   within this source.  If this callback isn't implemented,
   enum_active_sources will be called instead.  Only used with sources
   that have the OBS_SOURCE_COMPOSITE output capability flag.

   This is typically used if a source can have inactive child sources.

   :param  enum_callback: Enumeration callback
   :param  param:         User data to pass to callback

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.media_play_pause)(void *data, bool pause)

   Called to pause or play media.

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.media_restart)(void *data)

   Called to restart the media.

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.media_stop)(void *data)

   Called to stop the media.

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.media_next)(void *data)

   Called to go to the next media.

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.media_previous)(void *data)

   Called to go to the previous media.

.. member:: int64_t (*obs_source_info.media_get_duration)(void *data)

   Called to get the media duration.

.. member:: int64_t (*obs_source_info.media_get_time)(void *data)

   Called to get the current time of the media.

.. member:: void (*obs_source_info.media_set_time)(void *data, int64_t milliseconds)

   - **OBS_MEDIA_STATE_NONE**      - None
   - **OBS_MEDIA_STATE_PLAYING**   - Playing

   - **OBS_MEDIA_STATE_ERROR**     - Error

.. member:: obs_missing_files_t *(*missing_files)(void *data)

   Called to get the missing files of the source.

.. member:: enum gs_color_space (*obs_source_info.video_get_color_space)(void *data, size_t count, const enum gs_color_space *preferred_spaces)

   Returns the color space of the source. Assume GS_CS_SRGB if not
   implemented.

   There's an optimization an SDR source can do when rendering to HDR.
   Check if the active space is GS_CS_709_EXTENDED, and return
   GS_CS_709_EXTENDED instead of GS_CS_SRGB to avoid an redundant
   conversion. This optimization can only be done if the pixel shader
   outputs linear 709, which is why it's not performed by default.

   :return: The color space of the video

General Source Functions
------------------------

.. function:: void obs_register_source(struct obs_source_info *info)

   Registers a source type.  Typically used in
   :c:func:`obs_module_load()` or in the program's initialization phase.

---------------------

.. function:: const char *obs_source_get_display_name(const char *id)

   Calls the :c:member:`obs_source_info.get_name` callback to get the
   translated display name of a source type.

   :param    id:            The source type string identifier
   :return:                 The translated display name of a source type

---------------------

.. function:: obs_source_t *obs_source_create(const char *id, const char *name, obs_data_t *settings, obs_data_t *hotkey_data)

   Creates a source of the specified type with the specified settings.

   The "source" context is used for anything related to presenting
   or modifying video/audio.  Use :c:func:`obs_source_release` to release it.

   :param   id:             The source type string identifier
   :param   name:           The desired name of the source.  If this is
                            not unique, it will be made to be unique
   :param   settings:       The settings for the source, or *NULL* if
                            none
   :param   hotkey_data:    Saved hotkey data for the source, or *NULL*
                            if none
   :return:                 A reference to the newly created source, or
                            *NULL* if failed

---------------------

.. function:: obs_source_t *obs_source_create_private(const char *id, const char *name, obs_data_t *settings)

   Creates a 'private' source which is not enumerated by
   :c:func:`obs_enum_sources()`, and is not saved by
   :c:func:`obs_save_sources()`.

   Author's Note: The existence of this function is a result of design
   flaw: the front-end should control saving/loading of sources, and
   functions like :c:func:`obs_enum_sources()` and
   :c:func:`obs_save_sources()` should not exist in the back-end.

   :param   id:             The source type string identifier
   :param   name:           The desired name of the source.  For private
                            sources, this does not have to be unique,
                            and can additionally be *NULL* if desired
   :param   settings:       The settings for the source, or *NULL* if
                            none
   :return:                 A reference to the newly created source, or
                            *NULL* if failed

---------------------

.. function:: obs_source_t *obs_source_duplicate(obs_source_t *source, const char *desired_name, bool create_private)

   Duplicates a source.  If the source has the
   OBS_SOURCE_DO_NOT_DUPLICATE output flag set, this only returns a
   new reference to the same source. Either way,
   release with :c:func:`obs_source_release`.

   :param source:         The source to duplicate
   :param desired_name:   The desired name of the new source.  If this is
                          not a private source and the name is not unique,
                          it will be made to be unique
   :param create_private: If *true*, the new source will be a private
                          source if fully duplicated

.. function:: void obs_source_release(obs_source_t *source)

   Releases a reference to a source.  When the last reference is
   released, the source is destroyed.

              obs_source_t *obs_weak_source_get_source(obs_weak_source_t *weak)

   These functions are used to get an incremented weak reference from a strong source
   reference, or an incremented strong source reference from a weak reference. If
   the source is destroyed, *obs_weak_source_get_source* will return
   *NULL*. Release with :c:func:`obs_weak_source_release()` or
   :c:func:`obs_source_release()`, respectively.

---------------------

.. function:: void obs_weak_source_addref(obs_weak_source_t *weak)
              void obs_weak_source_release(obs_weak_source_t *weak)

   Adds/releases a weak reference to a source.

---------------------

.. function:: void obs_source_remove(obs_source_t *source)

   Notifies all reference holders of the source (via

              uint32_t obs_get_source_output_flags(const char *id)

   :return: Capability flags of a source

   Author's Note: "Output flags" is poor wording in retrospect; this
   should have been named "Capability flags", and the OBS_SOURCE_*
   macros should really be OBS_SOURCE_CAP_* macros instead.

   See :c:member:`obs_source_info.output_flags` for more information.

---------------------

.. function:: obs_data_t *obs_get_source_defaults(const char *id)

   Calls :c:member:`obs_source_info.get_defaults` to get the defaults
   settings of the source type.

   :return: The default settings for a source type

.. function:: void obs_source_update(obs_source_t *source, obs_data_t *settings)

   Updates the settings for a source and calls the
   :c:member:`obs_source_info.update` callback of the source.  If the
   source is a video source, the :c:member:`obs_source_info.update` will
   be not be called immediately; instead, it will be deferred to the
   video thread to prevent threading issues.

---------------------

.. function:: void obs_source_reset_settings(obs_source_t *source, obs_data_t *settings)

   Same as :c:func:`obs_source_update`, but clears existing settings
   first.

---------------------

.. function:: void obs_source_video_render(obs_source_t *source)

   Renders a video source.  This will call the
   :c:member:`obs_source_info.video_render` callback of the source.

              uint32_t obs_source_get_height(obs_source_t *source)

   Calls the :c:member:`obs_source_info.get_width` or
   :c:member:`obs_source_info.get_height` of the source to get its width
   and/or height.

   Author's Note: These functions should be consolidated in to a single
   function/callback rather than having a function for both width and
   height.

   :return: The width or height of the source

---------------------

.. function:: enum gs_color_space obs_source_get_color_space(obs_source_t *source, size_t count, const enum gs_color_space *preferred_spaces)

.. function:: float obs_transition_get_time(obs_source_t *transition)

   :return: The current transition time value (0.0f..1.0f)

---------------------

.. function:: void obs_transition_video_render(obs_source_t *transition, obs_transition_video_render_callback_t callback)
              void obs_transition_video_render2(obs_source_t *transition, obs_transition_video_render_callback_t callback, gs_texture_t *placeholder_texture)

   Helper function used for rendering transitions.  This function will
   render two distinct textures for source A and source B of the
   transition, allowing the ability to blend them together with a pixel
   shader in a desired manner.

   The *a* and *b* parameters of *callback* are automatically rendered
   textures of source A and source B, *t* is the time value
   (0.0f..1.0f), *cx* and *cy* are the current dimensions of the
   transition, and *data* is the implementation's private data.

   The *placeholder_texture* parameter allows a callback to receive
   a replacement that isn't the default transparent texture, including
   NULL if the caller desires.

   Relevant data types used with this function:

.. code:: cpp

   typedef void (*obs_transition_video_render_callback_t)(void *data,
                   gs_texture_t *a, gs_texture_t *b, float t,
                   uint32_t cx, uint32_t cy);

---------------------

.. function:: enum gs_color_space obs_transition_video_get_color_space(obs_source_t *transition)

   Figure out the color space that encompasses both child sources.

   The wider space wins.

   :return: The color space of the transition

---------------------

.. function::  bool obs_transition_audio_render(obs_source_t *transition, uint64_t *ts_out, struct obs_source_audio_mix *audio, uint32_t mixers, size_t channels, size_t sample_rate, obs_transition_audio_mix_callback_t mix_a_callback, obs_transition_audio_mix_callback_t mix_b_callback)

   Helper function used for transitioning audio.  Typically you'd call
   this in the obs_source_info.audio_render callback with its
   parameters, and use the mix_a_callback and mix_b_callback to
   determine the the audio fading of source A and source B.

   Relevant data types used with this function:

.. code:: cpp

   typedef float (*obs_transition_audio_mix_callback_t)(void *data, float t);

---------------------

.. function:: void obs_transition_swap_begin(obs_source_t *tr_dest, obs_source_t *tr_source)
              void obs_transition_swap_end(obs_source_t *tr_dest, obs_source_t *tr_source)

   Swaps two transitions.  Call obs_transition_swap_begin, swap the
   source, then call obs_transition_swap_end when complete.  This allows
   the ability to seamlessly swap two different transitions without it
   affecting the output.

   For example, if a transition is assigned to output channel 0, you'd
   call obs_transition_swap_begin, then you'd call obs_set_output_source
   with the new transition, then call
   :c:func:`obs_transition_swap_begin()`.
