Compilation instructions!  Temporary quick compilation instructions!
Will give better instructions later when things are in a more complete state.

Windows:
  - Use VS2013, as obs-studio uses C99 and C++11

  - Download latest FFmpeg repositories and Qt5 release

  - Create a windows environment variable FFmpegPath.  Set it to your FFmpeg
    repo path

  - Create a windows environment variable QTDIR.  Set it to your
    Qt5 install path

  - Compile FFmpeg and Qt5(Until they release a binary VS2013 version).
    They should both be compiled with VS2013.
    For compiling FFmpeg, see http://ffmpeg.org/platform.html#Windows

  - Create two directories in FFmpeg directory, lib32 and lib64.  Place the
    lib files generated by FFmpeg into these directories for the respective
    architecture

  - If compiling FFmpeg with shared libraries (DLLs), place the DLLs into
    build/bin/32bit and/or build/bin/64bit respectively

  - Compile project with VS2013, and it should be good to go.

  - NOTE: Direct3D 11 library may require D3Dcompiler_47.dll to be present
    in both the obs-studio/build/bin/32bit and obs-studio/build/bin/64bit
    directories


Mac OSX
  - Use macports or homebrew and get FFmpeg, cmake and Qt5.

  - In a terminal, you need to point the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH by doing:
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path to qt5 folder/5.2.0/lib/cmake/"

  - Then to build project, type: cmake /path to obs-studio folder/ && make && cpack
  
  - This one command creates a tmp folder on your desktop and places all files to it
    (you need to use your own paths):
    
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.2.0/lib/cmake/"
    &&  mkdir Desktop/tmp && cd Desktop/tmp && cmake /path to obs-studio folder/
    && make && cpack
  
  - "make" builds in a modular structure similar to windows, where everything    necessary to run the program is compiled to tmp/rundir
  
  - cpack create an obs-studio-x64-*******.dmg image, which contains "OBS studio"app bundle, it makes it so you
      don't have to use the terminal to execute it from the correct directory

Linux
  - If using debian-based distributions, you may have to get the latest FFmpeg
    repo -- default debian packages seem to be a bit lacking, so you might have
    to either get precompiled packages from http://deb-multimedia.org/ (or
    similar sources, use your own judgement) or get the latest FFmpeg repo,
    compile, and do a make install

  - Instructions pending -- linux code still under construction, and not yet
    fully functioning.  Will add more information later
