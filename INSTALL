Compilation instructions!  Temporary quick compilation instructions!
Will give better instructions later when things are in a more complete state.

Windows:
  - NOTE: OBS on windows currently requires VS2013, as obs-studio uses C99 and
    C++11.  Express might not be supported at this time (though I'll fix it at
    some point).

  - Clone the repo.  After cloning, run the following git commands:
        git submodule init
        git submodule update
    which will download submodules.

  - Download (or build) development packages of FFmpeg, x264, Qt5.

  - Download windows version of cmake from: http://www.cmake.org/

  - Add windows environment variables:
        FFMpegPath    (path to FFmpeg include directory)
        x264Path      (path to x264 include directory)
        QTDIR         (path to Qt build base directory)

    NOTE: Each of these environment variables can specify 32bit and 64bit by
    appending 32 and 64 to the end of the environment variable names.
    So if you want to separate locations for 32bit or 64bit, you can set:
    FFmpegPath32, FFmpegPath64, x264Path32, x264Path64, QTDIR32, QTDIR64, etc.

    NOTE: These variables are optional and these can be entered in to cmake
    while generating, but having these variables makes life much easier in case
    you need to regenerate your cmake data from scratch for whatever reason.

    NOTE: An example Qt directory you would use here if you installed Qt5 to
    D:\Qt would usually look something like this for the 32bit version:
        D:\Qt\5.3\msvc2013
    And something like this for the 64bit version
        D:\Qt\5.3\msvc2013_64

    NOTE: Search paths and search order for FFmpeg and x264 library/binary
    files, relative to their include directories:

        Library files
          ../lib
          ../lib32 (if 32bit)
          ../lib64 (if 64bit)
          ./lib
          ./lib32 (if 32bit)
          ./lib64 (if 64bit)

        Binary files:
          ../bin
          ../bin32 (if 32bit)
          ../bin64 (if 64bit)
          ./bin
          ./bin32 (if 32bit)
          ./bin64 (if 64bit)

  - Run cmake-gui.  In "where is the source code", enter in the repo directory
    (example: D:/obs).  In "where to build the binaries", enter the repo
    directory path with the 'build' subdirectory (example: D:/obs/build).

    NOTE: The subdirectories 'build', 'release', and 'debug' are meant for
    builds, and are excluded from the repo in .gitignore, so they are safe to
    use for building.

  - Press 'Configure', then enable the COPY_DEPENDENCIES option, then press
    'Configure' again, and then press 'Generate' to generate visual studio
    project files in the 'build' subdirectory.

  - Open obs-studio.sln from the 'build' subdirectory, and it should run and
    be good to go.  All required dependencies should be copied on compile and
    it should be a fully fuctional build environment.


Mac OSX
  - Use macports or homebrew and install FFmpeg, x264, Qt5, and cmake.

    NOTE: Qt5 can also be downloaded/installed via the Qt website, though keep
    in mind that you will have to set the QTDIR environment variable to the
    Qt5 build base directory.

  - In a terminal, go to the obs-studio directory create a 'build' sub
    directory and change to it, then to build, type: cmake .. && make

  - It builds in a modular structure by default.  To run it via terminal, go to
    build/rundir/RelWithDebInfo/bin, then type ./obs to run.

    NOTE: If you are running via command prompt, you *must* be in the 'bin'
    directory specified above, otherwise it will not be able to find its files
    relative to the binary.

  - To create an app bundle instead, use the command: make package
    This will create a .dmg file with an app bundle inside.


Linux
  - You need a fairly recent Linux distribution.
    Ubuntu 14.04 or a similar recent Linux distribution works fine, but
    anything that's up-to-date should work.
    Ubuntu 13.10 or older will _not_ work because of the ancient
    version of libav they use.

  - Because Ubuntu and Debian come with libav instead of ffmpeg, you have
    to get the original ffmpeg. Recommended:
    For Ubuntu 14.04:
      https://launchpad.net/~jon-severinsson/+archive/ubuntu/ffmpeg
    For Debian:
      http://www.deb-multimedia.org/

  - There is also a ppa available in case you do not want to compile
    yourself(Ubuntu 14.04 only):
      https://launchpad.net/~btbn/+archive/ubuntu/obs-studio

  - Build dependencies on Ubuntu 14.04 with ffmpeg ppa from above:
    cmake libpulse-dev qtbase5-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev libavcodec-dev
    libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libx264-dev libswresample-dev
    libfdk-aac-dev libxinerama-dev libxcomposite-dev libxrandr-dev

  - Building in portable mode(assuming you are in a terminal in the
    obs-studio base dir):
    
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="${HOME}/obs-studio-portable" ..
    make -j4 && make install

  - After that you should have a portable install in ~/obs-studio-portable
    Change to bin/64bit or bin/32bit and run ./obs to run it.

  - If you want to install obs-studio into your system, it's recommended
    to use checkinstall instead of a plain make install. It allows for a
    clean uninstall and allows the package manager to keep track of the
    installed files:

    sudo apt-get install checkinstall
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
    make -j4
    sudo checkinstall
