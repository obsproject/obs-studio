UI MODULES:

So the system have two Views... the ActiveFrame View... Which is very similar to how it is today... Where you have your control buttons and previews.
Then if you press TAB you can switch to Blueprint view. Where instead of deep convoluted Settings UI. WE have node based manipulation of anything from sources, to the virtualcam(layermixer), to the 3d assets, to the onnx models we run, to scripted behavior, sound, , 


So we have to views each with diffrient modules that work together across.
